This is the old version of MsgFleet. This repository represents the way how i decided to
go to micro-service application from monolitic architect. While this code is not useful anymore,
it is possible to see this code as a experience gained from my mistakes and bugs i have solved
and bringed by over-engeenering. Still you can checkout the utils, settings (In Django Style, 
all in one file) and other useful packages and learn by my mistakes.
